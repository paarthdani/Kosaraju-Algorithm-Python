# Kosaraju's Algorithm in Python
Kosaraju's algorithm is a linear time algorithm to find the strongly connected components of a directed graph.
There are 2 implementations developed in this code. Both implementation will take different inputs.

#### Implementation 1

It is an implementation of a problem statement "Design an Algorithm to determine minimum number of routes or connections possible to one way flights to reach from one airport to another".

#### Implementation 2

It is an implementation of a node based Kosaraju's Algorithm.
